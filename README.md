# 🌍 Earth & Moon 3D Animation – Three.js

An interactive 3D animation of Earth and Moon revolving in space, built using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). This project simulates planetary motion with realistic lighting, camera controls, and smooth orbital animations.

## 🚀 Features

- 🌎 Realistic animation of Earth and Moon revolving around each other.
- 💡 Simulated sunlight using Three.js `PointLight` and `AmbientLight`.
- 🎥 Interactive camera controls (orbit, zoom, pan) with `OrbitControls`.
- ⚙️ Smooth animation loop using `requestAnimationFrame` for seamless experience.
- 🧠 Educational project to explore 3D scene rendering, lighting, and object transformations.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack

- **Three.js** – WebGL library for 3D graphics
- **JavaScript** – Core scripting
- **HTML/CSS** – Project scaffolding and styling
